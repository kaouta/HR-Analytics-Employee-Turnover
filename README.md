# HR-Analytics-Employee-Turnover
Predicting Employee Turnover with Supervised Machine Learning(ANN,SVC,KNN,XGBOOST,Random Forest,Logistic Regression....)
Employee attrition is a loss to company in both monetary and non-monetary,in this project we will uncover the factors that lead to employee retention and develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit the company 
## About the work:
In this project we will:
* Performing exploratory data analysis to learn why employeen do leave or stay
* Train a logistic regression classifier ,random forest classifier , ANN model.... and compare their accuracy
* Apply sigmoid function to obtain probability
* Do some Data Visualization to plot Kernel density enstimate(KDE) plots,boxplots,countplots...
* Evaluate classification models using confusion matrix,precision,recall and F1-score.
